# ECE 425 (sp25) repo for Yu Kai Fu
◦ Basic cells design \
◦ Designed the schematic and layout of the datapath of a 32-bit RV32I compliant single-cycle processor using
bitslice methodology. \
◦ Verified functionality and design correctness using SystemVerilog testbenches. \
◦ Utilized Tcl scripting to automate synthesis and PnR processes, optimizing design constraints with the
overall CPU architecture
